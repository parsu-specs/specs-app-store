# Development setup

## Install and run

1. Clone the repository and enter `specs-app-store`.
2. Run `npm install` with a Node version supported by the installed Vite release.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`Copy-Item .env.example .env` in PowerShell).
4. Choose a backend below, then run `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:3000.

Vite reads environment configuration at startup; restart after changes. `.env` and `dist/` are ignored by Git. Never place service-role keys or OAuth client secrets in browser variables.

## Local demo (default)

Leave `VITE_DATA_SOURCE` unset or set it to `local`. Accounts, profiles, and projects persist in this browser's localStorage. Register with email/password. A Google button requires a valid `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`; email signup works without it. Settings offers a local project/activity reset.

## Supabase

Set `VITE_DATA_SOURCE=supabase`, `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. Apply the SQL described in [backends](backends.md). Enable email/password and, if needed, Google in Supabase Auth. Google uses the Supabase redirect flow; allow the development/production origin with `/discover`, and the recovery destination `/signin?mode=recovery`. Configure provider credentials in the appropriate dashboards.

If Supabase CAPTCHA is enabled, configure the matching `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`; its secret belongs in Supabase. The site key is public. Test signup, signin, and password recovery against the selected environment.

## Custom HTTP backend

Set `VITE_DATA_SOURCE=http` and `VITE_API_URL` to a server implementing the [repository endpoint contract](backends.md). This repository supplies the browser adapter, not that server.
